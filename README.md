[00:10.86] When I was a young boy
[00:15.05] My father took me into the city
[00:19.85] To see a marching band
[00:22.69] He said, "Son, when you grow up
[00:26.72] Would you be the savior of the broken
[00:30.93] The beaten and the damned?"
[00:36.23] He said, "Will you defeat them?
[00:39.99] Your demons, and all the non-believers
[00:44.53] The plans that they have made?"
[00:48.60] "Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
[00:52.93] To lead you in the summer
[00:57.03] To join the black parade"
[01:09.53] 
[01:15.09] When I was a young boy
[01:18.08] My father took me into the city
[01:22.75] To see a marching band
[01:33.75] 
[01:26.90] He said, "Son, when you grow up
[01:31.43] Would you be the savior of the broken
[01:34.48] The beaten and the damned?"
[01:47.98] 
[01:56.16] Sometimes I get the feelin'
[01:58.65] She's watchin' over me
[02:00.94] And other times I feel like I should go
[02:04.46] And through it all, the rise and fall
[02:08.14] The bodies in the streets
[02:10.41] And when you're gone, we want you all to know
[02:32.91] 
[02:15.27] We'll carry on, we'll carry on
[02:17.67] And though you're dead and gone, believe me
[02:23.01] Your memory will carry on
[02:35.51] 
[02:25.88] We'll carry on
[02:29.95] And in my heart, I can't contain it
[02:33.32] The anthem won't explain it
[02:46.82] 
[02:36.33] A world that sends you reelin'
[02:38.71] From decimated dreams
[02:40.58] Your misery and hate will kill us all
[02:44.79] So paint it black and take it back
[02:48.29] Let's shout it loud and clear
[02:50.60] Defiant to the end, we hear the call
[03:08.60] 
[02:54.53] To carry on, we'll carry on
[02:58.13] And though you're dead and gone, believe me
[03:02.88] Your memory will carry on
[03:15.38] 
[03:06.36] We'll carry on
[03:08.84] And though you're broken and defeated
[03:12.51] Your weary widow marches
[03:24.51] 
[03:16.30] On and on, we carry through the fears
[03:18.83] Oh, ah, ha
[03:21.18] Disappointed faces of your peers
[03:24.16] Oh, ah, ha
[03:26.02] Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all
[03:50.52] 
[03:30.72] Do or die, you'll never make me
[03:33.63] Because the world will never take my heart
[03:36.60] Go and try, you'll never break me
[03:39.37] We want it all, we wanna play this part
[03:58.87] 
[03:42.16] I won't explain or say I'm sorry
[03:45.24] I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
[03:48.11] Give a cheer for all the broken
[03:50.45] Listen here, because it's who we are
[04:08.45] 
[03:52.60] Just a man, I'm not a hero
[03:55.79] Just a boy, who had to sing this song
[03:58.76] Just a man, I'm not a hero
[04:01.09] I don't care
[04:07.09] 
[04:04.65] We'll carry on, we'll carry on
[04:08.19] And though you're dead and gone, believe me
[04:12.23] Your memory will carry on
[04:24.73] 
[04:15.25] You'll carry on
[04:18.77] And though you're broken and defeated
[04:22.72] Your weary widow marches, oh
[04:36.72] 
[04:25.75] Do or die, you'll never make me
[04:29.16] Because the world will never take my heart
[04:31.43] Go and try, you'll never break me
[04:35.88] We want it all, we wanna play this part (we'll carry on)
[04:38.84] Do or die, you'll never make me (we'll carry on)
[04:40.79] Because the world will never take my heart (we'll carry on)
[04:44.02] Go and try, you'll never break me (we'll carry on)
[04:46.34] We want it all, we wanna play this part (we'll carry on!)
